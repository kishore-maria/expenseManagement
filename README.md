# expenseManagement

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.0.

# Install packages

Run `npm i` for install node packages which are support to our project.

## Local environment

First go to the root directory using `cd <directory_name>`.

Run `npm start` for builds and serves your app, rebuilding on file changes.

Run `npm run serve` for start the server.js file which is used to start the express and mongo service.

We have to run above two commands at the same time using two command line windows. 

Then our application will loads on chrome with `localhost:4200`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
